<!-- All features together in these models explained variance up to r = 0.55 (mean = 0.182 ± 0.109; range = 0.0039–0.551). To understand how specific features contributed to this total explained variance, we characterized each neuron and each recording site according to the unique variance (R2) (ref. 36) for each of the six major classes of speech features (Fig. 3a) (acoustic–phonetic features were collapsed into vowels, voiced consonants and unvoiced consonants; only neurons with full model r value of greater than 95% shuffled permutation distribution are included) (‘Model comparisons’). We used unique R2 because it provides a robust and relatively conservative estimate of variance attributable to each group of features, which is critical for speech where many features are correlated with one another.All features together in these models explained variance up to r = 0.55 (mean = 0.182 ± 0.109; range = 0.0039–0.551).
